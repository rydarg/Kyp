# Kyp 
Kyp or Know Your Phrases is an android app that displays lists of commonly used vocabulary words in a language. 
This app is based on the Miwok app that was developed as a part of Udacity Android Beginners course.

As of now, the touch to speak functionality, has been removed. I'll re-add them at a later stage.
